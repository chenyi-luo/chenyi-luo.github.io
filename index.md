## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="portrait.jpg">

Hi! I am a Postdoc fellow in Prof. [Laura De Lorenzis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=qYnztGgAAAAJ)'s [Computational Mechanics Group](https://compmech.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I received my doctoral degree (Dr.-Ing) from the Institute of Applied Mechanics (Civil Engineering) at the University of Stuttgart in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. [Wolfgang Ehlers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GrHhBGkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I received my master's degree of science in computational mechanics of materials and structures ([COMMAS program](https://www.commas.uni-stuttgart.de/program/)) also from the Univeristy of Stuttgart. Before that, I received a bachelor degree of Engineering from Tongji University in Shagnhai, China.
