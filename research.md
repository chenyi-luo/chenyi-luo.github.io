My research develops fully coupled models and efficient numerical algorithms to facilitate a through understanding of natural phenomena and engineering activities. Typical applications include hydraulic fracturing and desiccation cracks. 


* Phase-field modeling of fracturing saturated porous media with application to hydraulic fracturing




* Phase-field modeling of fracturing __unsaturated__ porous media with application to desiccation
